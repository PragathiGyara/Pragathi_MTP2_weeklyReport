Time Spent : 9 - 10 hours

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify all implemented features
    \item Complete reading Digital Minimalism book
    \item Survey
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Objective 1 : Testing}
\subsubsection{Frontend}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify all usage metrics are measured accurately
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Screen time
        \item Unlock Count
        \item App launch count
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ensure that usage metrics are consistently represented across the application.
    Currently the usage data is displayed on: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lock Screen
        \item Home Screen
        \item Notification bar
        \item App Drawer
        \item Dashboard
    \end{itemize}
    Test whether: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item all components are showing identical values 
        \item are there any inconsistencies due to using shared preferences for storing the usage metrics. 

        Instead, database can be used.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Test if alarm is triggering on time. Some of the conditions to test under: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Low battery
        \item Battery saver mode
        \item Idle state mode
    \end{itemize}

    \item Verify if the alarmManager behaviour works same for all devices. 

    \item How does the alarm behave when phone was switched off during the triggering time.

    \item Check if API calls are efficient.
\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection{Server side}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Check if celery worker to update points boundary is triggering on time
    \item Check if leaderboard is calculated right?
    \item Backend frontend consistencys
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Objective 3 : Survey}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Google Form link: \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p_3wBV6kxQMTjSB3DH2tA4sDBrUBfmnHJPrCuGDaASA/edit}{Link}
    \item QR Code
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Observations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Created a new account. The baseline data of last 7 days didn't upload (it was uploaded only for previous day). Refer Fig. \ref{fig:Baseline data not uploaded correctly}

    \item The next day usage session data is also considered as baseline. Refer Fig. \ref{fig:Baseline data not uploaded correctly}
\end{enumerate}

Time Spent : 22-23h
\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verification of implemented features.
    \item Bug resolution in code to upload last 7 days usage data (baseline data) into the server. \hfill \textbf{[DONE]}
    \item Survey \hfill \textbf{[DONE]}
    \item Analysis of responses from survey 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{comment}
\subsection{New Feature Ideas from the Digital Minimalism book}
\end{comment}

\subsection{Survey}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conducted on 24th Dec 2025.
    \item Received 47 responses via google forms.
    \item Observations: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many people were already familiar with digital wellbeing app on android.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Uploading Baseline Data}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The baseline worker is called when the user logins for the first time. The status of baseline data uploaded or not in stored in login pref. If the value is 'false', the baseline data is uploaded, if its 'true' the baseline worker is called.
    
    \item Right now, the baseline worker is not uploading all the 7 days data as intented.
    
    \item Bugs found in the baseline worker:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mismatch in session timings. \hfill \textbf{[RESOLVED]}
        
            \textit{Issue:} The day, evening, and night sessions were calculated using the wrong day reference, so some sessions were outside the intended 5 pm–5 pm window. 
            
            \textit{Fix:} The session timings were corrected so that all sessions fall properly within the 5 pm–5 pm day.
        
        \item Anomaly if the baseline worker is called before 5 pm. \hfill \textbf{[RESOLVED]}
        
            \textit{Issue:} When the baseline worker ran before 5 pm, it tried to upload data for a day that was still in progress.
            
            \textit{Fix:} The worker was updated to always upload the last fully completed day by shifting the baseline window when needed.
            
        \item 7 days data not uploaded. Ref \ref{fig:Incomplete Baseline Upload} \hfill \textbf{[RESOLVED]}
\begin{figure} 
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/IncorrectBaselineUpload.png}

            \label{fig:Incomplete Baseline Upload}
        \end{figure}
                
        \item Error when total session is trying to be uploaded. Ref \ref{fig:Error While Uploading Baseline} \hfill \textbf{[RESOLVED]}

        \textit{Fix:} Temporarily commented out the 
        \texttt{HealthConnectUtils.readStepsBetweenBlocking} since there was no usage.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Verification of screen time}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Different screen time interpretations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item time screen in ON
        \item time any app is in foreground \textbf{(currently used)}
        \item time user is actively interacting
    \end{itemize}
    \item Methods for verification: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compare with baseline
        \item Controlled experiments
        \item Maintaining correctness
    \end{itemize}
    \item Approach : 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Compare with baseline}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choice of baseline: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Primary : Digital Wellbeing
        \item Secondary : popular apps from play store (with high number of downloads)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Why Digital Wellbeing : 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
    \item JODO vs Digital Wellbeing. Ref table \ref{tab:Interpretation of screen time - JODO vs Digital Wellbeing}

    \begin{table}
        \centering
        \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X X}\hline
             &  JODO & Digital Wellbeing\\\hline
             Interpretation of screen time&  Time spent by any app on the foreground expect JODO & Either,
Time spent by any app on the foreground 
(OR)
Time screen is ON\\\hline
             Duration of day&  5 pm to 5 pm & 12 am to 12 am\\ \hline

        \caption{Interpretation of screen time - JODO vs Digital Wellbeing}
        \label{tab:Interpretation of screen time - JODO vs Digital Wellbeing}
    \end{table}

    \item Approach : 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Collect data from digital wellbeing
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Approximate the data to 5 pm to 5 pm. How to approximate : 
            \item Check if the digital wellbeing screen time interpretation matches with JODO, even when JODO is installed in the phone.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Collect data from JODO.
        \item Plot the graph.
        \item Analyze if there any anomalies.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Difficulties:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No API to access Digital Wellbeing data.
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Observations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Digital Wellbeing app not shown in the app launcher of JODO.
\end{enumerate}

Time Spent = 6 h + 7 h + 8 h + 2 h + 7 h = 30 h  
\subsection{Verification of Measurement of Usage Metrics}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Approach : 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Via our app, allow to note the start and end time of the experiment.
        \item Android exposes 3 ways to note the usage.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item UsageEvents : logs of events. 
            \item EventStats : aggregate of event types
            \item UsageStats : aggregate of app usage
        \end{enumerate}
        \item So at the end of the experiment - all these methods are accessed and their values are stored in app logs and maybe presented on the app UI.
        \item It is expected to manually note the usage pattern to cross verify if usage metrics are measured correctly.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Implementation : 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented 3 methods to find the screen time : 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Using \texttt{ACTIVITY\_RESUMED} and \texttt{ACTIVITY\_PAUSED} events from \texttt{UsageEvents}. This shall give us the time spent by app in the foreground \cite{Android_UsageEvents}. But summing all sessions - that is, time spent by each app on the foreground, we would get the screen time.

            Also, computing both including and excluding the launcher package from the screen time.

            \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Calculating screen time using activity resumed and paused flags}]
    long sessionDuration = event.getTimeStamp() - lastTimestamp;
    
    if(sessionDuration > 0){
        result.appScreenTimeIncludingLauncherMs += sessionDuration;
    }
    if(!pkg.equals(launcherPackage) && !pkg.equals(getPackageName())) {
        result.appScreenTimeExcludingLauncherMs +=sessionDuration;      
    } 
            \end{lstlisting}

            \item Using \texttt{SCREEN\_INTERACTIVE} and \texttt{SCREEN\_NON\_INTERACTIVE} events from \texttt{UsageEvents}. This shall give us the time when the display is on and user input is enabled. \cite{Android_UsageEvents}
            \item Aggregating the time spent on foreground using \texttt{UsageStats} - \texttt{getTotalTimeVisible()} and \texttt{getTotalTimeInForeground()} methods. \cite{Android_UsageStats}

            Difference between Visible and Foreground is that, visible is when the screen is on display. Foreground is when user input is enabled for that app.

            So, when we use foreground, split screen case can be handled. That is, when we run on split screen, if visible is used, since screen time is sum of time spent on each app - there is a change that, the screen time exceeds the actual screen on time. But since foreground accounts only for the time when the app has active user interaction, it might be more accurate. 
            \cite{MicrosoftLearn_UsageStats_TimeForeground}
            \cite{MicrosoftLearn_UsageStats_TimeVisible} 

            \textbf{\texttt{getTotalTimeVisible()} is used as fallback if \texttt{getTotalTimeInForeground()} is not available in the android version on the user's phone.}
            
            \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Calculating screen time using UsageStats},label={Calculating screen time using UsageStats}]
    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.Q) {
        foregroundTimeMs = stats.getTotalTimeVisible();
    } else {
        foregroundTimeMs = stats.getTotalTimeInForeground();
    }
            \end{lstlisting}

        \end{enumerate}

        \item Implemented 1 method to find unlock count based on the \texttt{KEYGUARD\_SHOWN} flag.

        \item Implemented an interface which allows us to start and end experiment. And then show the results of current experiment results on the interface at the end.

        \item Writing on the measured usage metrics onto the log file. Sample result of the entries made into the log file can be in seen in the figure \ref{fig:Usage Metrics Accuracy Testing Logs}

        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/AccuracyTestingLogs.png}
            \caption{Usage Metrics Accuracy Testing Logs}
            \label{fig:Usage Metrics Accuracy Testing Logs}
        \end{figure}
    \end{itemize}

    \item Testing Objectives:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Is UsageEvents and UsageStats giving the same data?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For small continuous usage intervals (5 min - 3 hours)
            \item For large continuous usage intervals (10 hours - 3 days)
            \item For small non-continuous usage intervals
            \item For large non-continuous usage intervals
        \end{itemize}
        \item Which of the 3 methods of screen time is closer to the actual measured screen time?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For small usage intervals
            \item For large usage intervals
        \end{itemize}
        \item How close is the unlok count measured using UsageEvents is to the actual unlock count.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Observations:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Unlock count measured using UsageEvents also included the cases where the keygurd shown but the phone is not actually unlocked - which matches which the definition of this flag as per the documentation \cite{Android_UsageEvents}. But it doesn't account for the actual unlock count.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

This is a review article published in 2018, discussing theories behind technology addictions and various interventions which are tested so far.
\subsubsection{Key Terms}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Psychosocial interventions : using psychological or social actions to produce changes in
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Symptoms}, that is, improve physical and mental health
        \item \textbf{Functioning}, that is, performance
        \item \textbf{Well-being}, that is, quality of life and life satisfaction.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Key Points}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Psychological and behavioral theories behind technology addictions: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Learning Theories :} That is, since technology use gives some kind of positive reinforcement, users are motivated to use more. This is also called as \textbf{operant conditioning}.
        \item \textbf{Reward-deficiency hypothesis :} seeking higher rewards than that from everyday activities.
        \item Impulsivity
        \item \textbf{Cognitive-behavioral models :} Using technology as an escape mechanism from real world problems.
        \item \textbf{Social skills deficiency theories :} drawn towards virtual world because of anxiousness in real world.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Psychosocial interventions mentioned : 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Psychotherapies
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Psychodynamic Therapy
            \item Cognitive-behavioural therapy

        \item Peer support services
        \item Integrated care interventions
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The interventions are said to be tested using randomized controlled clinical trials and meta analysis.
    \item Psychotherapy 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Commonly tested approaches : Cognitive behavioral therapy and Motivational enhancement therapy.
        \item Two methods of testing : Total abstinence and Controlled Use. Controlled Use was prefered.
        \item Cognitive Behavioral Therapy : 
        \item Motivational Enhancement Therapy

Paper Link: \cite{frontiers2025technological} (2025)
\subsubsection{Summary}
This paper conducts a systematic review (traditional meta analysis) and network meta-analysis of various intervention measures to reduce (or improve) mobile phone addiction among teenagers and young adults.
This paper considers 32 studies based on PICOS (Participants,interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design) methodology (The inclusion criteria is discussed in detailed notes.).
Meta-analysis is done using Rev Man 5.3 software. Network meta-analysis is done using Stata 16.0 software. 
The outcome of the meta-analysis is that all interventions considered perform better than control group (that is, no intervention). 
\textbf{The outcome of the network meta-analysis is that Badminton and Mindfulness-Based Therapy are the best interventions are highest ranked interventions among others.}
\subsubsection{Detailed Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Meta analysis}: Provides aggregate result of various interventions. 
    That is, when there are individual studies on a particular intervention, the studies can be combined statistically to get wider set of participants.
    And hence be more precise.

    This is limited to a single intervention. That is, it tells if one intervention is better than control group or not. Or sometimes offers pretest and posttest analysis - where there is no control group but the observations is made on the same group of people before and after intervention.
    \cite{Meta_Analysis1} \cite{Meta_Analysis2}

    \item \textbf{Network meta-analysis}: In this multiple interventions can be compared at once. It uses transitivity to determine relative ranking between the interventions. 
    That is, according to one intervention A is better than intervention B and according to another study if intervention B is better than intervention C, then network meta analysis says that intervention A is better than intervention C.

    \item Study : 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Out of 2348 studies from various databases, 32 studies were selected based on the inclusion criteria.
        \item The inclusion criteria (PICOS methodology):
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Participants : Teenagers or young adults who have mobile phone addiction (based on assessment performed before the start of the individual stuides.)
            \item Interventions : exercise interventions
            \item Comparisons : intervention vs control group.
            \item Outcomes : The addiction levels are measured in scales : SAS-SV (Smartphone Addiction Scale - Shortened Version) and MPAI (Mobile Phone Addiction Index).
            \item Study design : Randomized controlled trials.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item The various interventions (14) considered in the 32 studies are (their description not given in the paper): 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Aerobic Aerobics : Refered in the title \href{https://doi.org/10.27441/d.cnki.gyzdu.2022.000378}{Chao Y. Experimental study on the effects of aerobic aerobicsand badminton on
                moderate mobile phone addictionamong secondary vocational school students thesis
                (2022). Yangzhou University.} Unable to access the article. Assuming its aerobics.
            \item Badminton
            \item Baduanjin : form of physical exercise, common in China
            \item Basketball
            \item Biofeedback : monitoring body's involuntary functions like heart rate using monitoring systems. Providing feedback/therapy based on that. \cite{biofeedback}
            \item Tai Chi : form of physical exercise, common in China
            \item Table Tennis
            \item Jump rope
            \item Combined Intervention
            \item Mindfulness-Based Therapy : form of talk therapy
            \item Cognitive Therapy : form of talk therapy
            \item Sanda : form of kickboxing, common in China
            \item Volleyball
            \item Yoga
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Risk of bias assessment was performed using Cochrane Randomized Trial Risk Tool.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Selection bias (that is, how the control group and intervention group is choosen)- low risk or unclear risk. 
            \item Performance bias (that is, prior intimidation to the participants about the study can affect the performance during the study) - high risk.
            \item Detection bias (that is, how the outcome is measured. There both SAS-SV and MPAI scales are considered) - high risk.
            \item Incomplete outcome data
            \item Selective reporting
            \item Other sources of bias
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Meta Analysis : meta analysis was performed using a software Rev Man 5.3.
        This software gives SMD for each individual study and also pools SMD across studies.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Each study has its control group and intervention group. 
            \item The mean is the average of addiction scores (measures via SAS-SV or MPAI - detection bias) for each group.
            \item The pooled standard deviation is calculated using the standard deviations of both groups.
            \item The Standard Mean Difference (SMD) is calculated using: SMD = (Mean of intervention A - Mean of intervention B) / Pooled standard deviation. \cite{standardMeanDifference}
            \item If SMD \(> 0\), then intervention A is better than intervention B.
        \end{itemize}


        Outcome : Pooled SMD (that is, for all studies) = -1.38, 95\% CI (-1.75, -1.01). \textbf{That means, the interventions show a better scores than that of control group.}
        But the heterogeneity is said to be high - that is, around 94\%.

        \item Network meta-analysis : network meta-analysis was performed using the software Stata 16.0.
        The software generates a cummulative ranking probability curve.
        From these curves, the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) values were calculated.
        It ranges from 0 to 100, 100 being the best. A SUCRA value is assoicated to each intervention. \cite{sucra_probability}

        Outcome : Badminton had the highest value (93.8) \(> 0\) MBT (77.3) \(> 0\) Badunajin (74.3)..
        \item Limitations as reported:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item There were relatively few randomized controlled trails involving badminton and MBT considered in this study.
            \item High heterogeneity between the studies. So there is possibility that is can affect the results of the study.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}


\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Observations}
Positives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Attempts to provide ranking of intervention based on various studies - which increases the sample size.
    \item Badminton and Mindfulness-Based Therapy is reported to have a good effect on improving (that is, reducing) mobile phone addiction.
\end{enumerate}
Negatives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Out of 32 studies, 31 studies are based in China.
    \item The result of badminton reducing addiction can be biased since "badminton is one of the most participated sports among Chinese
mass sports enthusiasts, with a participation rate as high as 42.6\%."
    \item High risk of performance bias and detection bias.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{A meta analysis of psychological interventions for Internet/smartphone addiction among adolescents}
Paper Link : \cite{metaanalysis2019internetaddiction} (2019)
\subsubsection{Summary}
This paper does a meta analysis of 6 papers containing psychological interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), sandplay therapy and behaviour based educational programming. 
It explains the reasons for focusing on adolescents and also gives the theories behind compulsive internet usage.
The outcome of the meta analysis is that, these interventions show positive effect in reducing internet addictions. SMD of CBT based studies is -0.60 and SMD of educational programming is -0.76. Though there is no inference made to decide which is better - that is, no comparision is done to say which is better.

\subsubsection{Detailed Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 'Internet Gaming Disorder' added as a diagnosis in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition).
    \item Reason for focusing on adolescents (10 to 24 year olds) : 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Higher risk of psychological disorders like depression, loneliness, social problems and academic issues.
        \item Higher risk of suicidal tendencies
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Reasons for compulsive internet usage:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Cognitive Behavioral Model} : An individual's thoughts coupled with behaviour leads to abnormal behaviour.
        \item \textbf{Social skills deficit theory} : individual's preference of online over face-to-face social interactions also contributed to additive use of internet. 
        Feeling overwhelmed, personal problems or traumatic events in life can make individuals chose online over face-to-face interactions.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Psychological Intervention} : The purpose of a psychological intervention is to improve:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Symptoms : physical and mental health symptoms
        \item Functioning : performance in everyday activities
        \item Well-being : overall quality of life and life satisfaction
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The psychological interventions reviewed in this paper: cognitive based therapy, sandplay therapy, behaviour based educational programming.
    \item \textbf{Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)} : Based on the cognitive behavioral model. Helps identify the negative or problematic cognition/thought patterns via talk therapy. 
    \item \textbf{Sandplay Therapy} : Where individuals are asked to draw on sand to express their emotions.
    \item \textbf{Behaviour Based Educational Programming} : 
    \item Study:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 6 papers (2000 to 2019) were chosen based on the below criteria:
        
        Inclusion criteria:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) study design. 
            That is, there has to be a control group and intervention group randomly chosen.
            \item Participants are diagnoised for internet addiction.
            \item The purpoe of the study was to find the effects of the intervention.
        \end{itemize}
        Exclusion criteria:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Single group pre-post comparison study. That is, there was no control group.
            \item Study didn't report mean and standard deviations of the addiction levels/scores.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The interventions include CBT (3 studies), sandplay therapy(1 study) and behaviour based educational programming (2 studies).
        \item Out of 6 studies, 5 were conducted at Asian University and 1 at European University.
        \item A total of 305 adolescents aged 12 to 21 participated in the studies.            \item CBT study :
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Study 1 (eight session CBT): Initially there was no difference between active and control group at baseline. 
            But after 6 months, both groups showed decrease in scores but only CBT group showed improved time management skills and better emotional, cognitive and behavioral symptoms (stands with the purpose of a psychological intervention).
            \item Study 2 (eight session CBT + medication): Compared to non-CBT (only medication) group, CBT showed no significant decrease in depression symptoms but it showed decrease in time spent on internet gaming.
            \item Study 3 (two-stage intervention CBT - that is, cognitive reconstruction talks + daily logs): Improvement seen in reduced social media addiction and improved mental health and learning performance.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Sandplay Therapy:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Study 1: Showed reduction in time spent on internet.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Educational programming:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The aims of both studies were to improve academic performance, time management skills and reduce internet addiction.
            \item Both studies showed decrease in internet addiction.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Results : 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For all studies : SMD = -0.67, 95\% CI = -1.07 to -0.27. 
            \item For CBT : SMD = -0.60, 95\% CI = -1.38 to 0.19.
            \item For educational programming : SMD = -0.76, 95\% CI = -1.38 to -0.13.
            \item It shows that the interventions work better than no intervention at all (than control group).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Observations}
Positives
\begin{enumerate}
    \item heterogeneity is less compared to previous paper (current - 64\%, previous -94\%).
\end{enumerate}
Negatives
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Self-reported addiction scores were used.
    \item Only meta analysis performed. That is, based on SMD (since negative), we can say that the interventions in general have positive effect in reducing the internet addiction, but doesn't say which intervention exactly works better. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Psychosocial interventions for technological addictions}
Paper Link : \cite{sharma2018psychosocial} (2018)
\subsubsection{Summary}
This is a review article which talks about the psychosocial interventions, the theories behind technological addictions, and also discusses the interventions Cognitive based therapy and Motivational enhancement therapy in detail.

\subsubsection{Detailed Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Psychosocial interventions} : using both psychological (thoughts, emotions, behaviour) and social factors (people, environment) to produce changes in symptoms, functioning and well-being.
    \item Theories which explain technological addictions: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Learning Theories :} That is, since technology use gives some kind of positive reinforcement, users are motivated to use more. This is also called as \textbf{operant conditioning}.
        \item \textbf{Reward-deficiency hypothesis :} seeking higher rewards than that from everyday activities.
        \item \textbf{Impulsivity :} tendency to action without much forethought.
        \item \textbf{Cognitive-behavioral models :} Using technology as an escape mechanism from real world problems.
        \item \textbf{Social skills deficiency theories :} drawn towards virtual world because of anxiousness in real world.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Broad range of interventions :
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Psychotherapies
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Psychodynamic Therapy
            \item Cognitive-behavioural therapy
            \item Interpersonal psychotherapy
            \item Problem-solving therapy
        \end{itemize}
        \item Community based treatment
        \begin{itemize}
            \item assertive community treatment
            \item first episode psychosis intervention
        \end{itemize}
        \item Vocational Rehabilitation
        \item Peer support services
        \item Integrated care intervention
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and Motivational enhancement therapy (MET) are reported to be most frequently tested.
    \item Psychotherapeutic interventions can be done in two modes : Total abstinence and controlled use of technology. Given present need of smartphones, the model of abstience is recommeded only for the indiduals how failed to do controlled use. 
    \item Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Based on the cognitive behavioral model. Helps identify the negative or problematic cognition/thought patterns via talk therapy.
    \item 8 techniques suggested for CBT. That is, the therapist should helps the users figure out the following (?) : 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Practice the Opposite : disrupt the pattern of usage with a new schedule
        \item External stoppers : have prompts to take break or log off.
        \item Setting goals : set up achievable goals of usage time.
        \item abstinence from certain applications  : Totally not using the apps on which they don't have control.
        \item reminder cards : cards which remind users the cost of internet addiction.
        \item personal inventory : figuring out what activities they are missing out.
        \item support groups 
        \item family therapy
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Motivational Enhancement Therapy : This is also a kind of talk therapy where the therapist does non-confrontational, motivational conversation to figure out a personalized treatment plan and attainable goals. 
    Though this, the goal is also to make users realize their excessive or compulsive use.
\end{enumerate}
